Description: This package provides functions for summarizing common formats of acoustic 
    and Passive Integrated Transponder(PIT) tags.  It is geared toward fish acoustic telemetry data, and 
    specifically data from Vemco equipment, but strives to be equipment-agnostic.  
    Summary functions include getting the first and last detection, generating a track for a tagged animal, 
    and visualizing telemetry summaries.
